Strangely enough, we're still using products that were invented in the 2G era. There seems to be an emptiness with the current experience and today's products are built to force humanity to be superficial. .We'd like to change that. .With the advancements in technology, so much more is possible today that wasn't even possible, just a few years ago. We believe the timing couldn't be better. .6 Principles .We’re thoughtful about why we do things and here are 6 principles guiding our thinking: .Advancements in Tech & AI .: Allowing more bits to be pushed to users in real-time and thus allowing far richer, more personalised experiences. .Bits Cheaper than Atoms .: Today, bringing rich, luxurious experiences to the masses is faster, more efficient and cheaper online than it is offline. .Self Worth Moving Online .: 40% of people's waking life is now spent on their smartphones. The next generation is far more comfortable online than offline. .Vertical Communities .: We don't live our lives in one massive community. We're specific in the activities we engage in (art, gaming, fitness etc). .New Business Models .: Putting customer at the centre. These won't be ad-driven in the traditional sense. Think micro-transactions, subscriptions and more. .Consumers as Owners .: It's a bit strange that consumers aren't part of the value chain. Turning customers into owners is a fascinating thought. .Build Magical Things .It’s so clear to us that technology evolves but people stay the same. We’re solving for a core human need - social connection and with all the evolution in technology, today we can solve for that in brand new ways. .At our core, we’re a creative company. Ideas and pixels is where we live and we love building magical products that make our users feel ‘wow’ inside. It’s not just about features, it’s also about how they make people feel.
