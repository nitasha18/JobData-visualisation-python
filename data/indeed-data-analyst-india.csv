Job Description
Whom are we looking for?
BlueOptima has a truly unique collection of vast datasets relating to the changes that software developers make in source code when working in an enterprise software development environment.
We are looking for an analytically minded individual with expertise in statistical analysis, Machine Learning and Data Engineering. Who will work on real world problems, some of which are completely unique to the data that we have, develop new algorithms and tools to solve problems. This role would involve coordinating a small team of Data Engineers to develop the complete end to end solutions across multiple projects.
We would expect a successful candidate to have an advanced understanding of python, going beyond scripts and be confident in designing and building applications in python. Within BlueOptima we strive to automate where possible as this allows us to focus on the technically challenging elements in the problem.
What does the role involve?
As a senior Machine Learning Data Engineer you will take problems and ideas from our clients and customer support teams analyse what would be involved, whether the solution will solve the underlying problem, plan and develop solutions. Within time you should be able to provide your own pipeline of ideas or problems that we can tackle. As with many problems within the Data Engineering space defining effective pipelines to gather, curate and manage the data is as important as selecting the best ML algorithm.
You will take responsibility for the end to end process, this means that you will own the initial exploration of the data, the development of a solution, design the requirements for ongoing monitoring of the solution once it is released and tackle any issues that arise from the solution. Solution ownership is a fundamental part of the role and it is expected that you would not only take this for the solutions you develop but encourage others to own and take responsibility for the solutions they are involved in.
A successful candidate will be able to coordinate multiple projects within the team and plan which of these are the most valuable. Within the team understand the strengths and weaknesses of the individual members planning the balance of work accordingly, whilst ensuring that they are continually challenged. You should be comfortable doing this whilst completing your own work.
You will use tools ranging from advanced Machine Learning algorithms to Statistical approaches and will be able to select the best tool for the job. This means both being able to suggest the cutting edge approaches to problems and just as importantly identifying when a simpler approach will provide a solution which is as effective. Finally, you will support and identify improvements to our existing algorithms and approaches.

Develop additional & supporting metrics for the BlueOptima product and data predominantly using Python.
Produce ad hoc or bespoke analysis and reports.
Owning the final solution; coordinating with different teams including engineering and client side teams to take a solution from exploratory analysis to deployed in production.
Facilitate taking solutions into production, though active participation with the internal development teams.
Coordinate with internal and external stakeholders to understand requirements and opportunities to add value.
Spec the requirements to solve a problem and identify the critical path and timelines and be able to give clear estimates quantifying any uncertainty.
Resolve issues and find improvements to existing Machine Learning solutions and measure their impacts.
Takes data-driven approaches to validate assumptions/issues and track progress on changes being implemented.
ESSENTIAL SKILLS / EXPERIENCE REQUIRED:
