Strangely enough, we're still using products that were invented in the 2G era. There seems to be an emptiness with the current experience and today's products are built to force humanity to be superficial. .We'd like to change that. .With the advancements in technology, so much more is possible today that wasn't even possible, just a few years ago. We believe the timing couldn't be better. .6 Principles .We’re thoughtful about why we do things and here are 6 principles guiding our thinking: .Advancements in Tech & AI .: Allowing more bits to be pushed to users in real-time and thus allowing far richer, more personalised experiences. .Bits Cheaper than Atoms .: Today, bringing rich, luxurious experiences to the masses is faster, more efficient and cheaper online than it is offline. .Self Worth Moving Online .: 40% of people's waking life is now spent on their smartphones. The next generation is far more comfortable online than offline. .Vertical Communities .: We don't live our lives in one massive community. We're specific in the activities we engage in (art, gaming, fitness etc). .New Business Models .: Putting customer at the centre. These won't be ad-driven in the traditional sense. Think micro-transactions, subscriptions and more. .Consumers as Owners .: It's a bit strange that consumers aren't part of the value chain. Turning customers into owners is a fascinating thought. .Build Magical Things .It’s so clear to us that technology evolves but people stay the same. We’re solving for a core human need - social connection and with all the evolution in technology, today we can solve for that in brand new ways. .At our core, we’re a creative company. Ideas and pixels is where we live and we love building magical products that make our users feel ‘wow’ inside. It’s not just about features, it’s also about how they make people feel. We build at the intersection of the scientific and the romantic. .And it all starts with people, the right team that cares deeply about our mission, values and our users. At hike, you'll have the chance to do the best work of your life. .Come join us and shape the future of social. .The Hike Code .We’re on a journey to build something new, something different and making anything innovative & new requires the ability to surrender to the unknown. The Hike Code is our value system. It is our guide to navigate through the unknown to build incredible products. Here they are: .Top Talent in Every Role .: We look for people with an incredible intellect. Both skills and values are important to us. .Pro-Sports Team .: Strengths based, results driven with a ""team-first"" attitude .Customer at the Centre .: Everything we do is inspired by how can we better solve for our customer. .Constant Innovation .: It's our DNA to walk into the unknown in search of having meaningful impact. .Act Like Owners .: We own the output of what we do, even if it's explicitly not our job. .Thoughtful Decision Making .: Clear Mind + Obsession to Simplify + Data Driven. We strive to be thoughtful. .Always be Hustling .: We understand that success is not one big leap but tiny gains compounding over time #ABH. .Be Open Minded & Coachable .: We have a quest to continuously #RiseUp to be the best version of ourselves. .Role .If you've made it till here, you're probably still interested in the role :) .As a Data Analyst, you will: .Perform quantitative analyses that translate data into actionable insights and provide analytical, data-driven decision-making support for key projects. .Provide reporting and performance monitoring to product teams using data drawn from diverse sources. .Own and evangelize data-driven experimentation in the team to improve the product offerings, and document it. .Enable product reviews, deep dives and analyses through the effective use of data and communicate and report insights and recommendations to shape product strategy. .Ensure that any data required for carrying out the other responsibilities for the product/features you’re working on is properly instrumented and logged. .Requirements .Sounds Like You? .You have a Bachelor’s degree in Math, Statistics, Comp Science, Engineering, or other technical field required; advanced degrees strongly preferred. .You are hands on with Python/ Java Programming language. .You have a very good understanding of mobile and Internet products, growth strategies and business dynamics. .You are comfortable manipulating, transforming, and analysing complex, high-volume, high-dimensionality data from varying sources. .You have 3+ years experience performing quantitative analysis, preferably for an Internet or technology company. .You have hands-on working experience on SQL queries. .You have experience in reporting and dashboards involving very large datasets and multiple data sources, with the ability to interpret data and produce meaningful insights. .You have good understanding of statistical analysis, data warehousing, data modelling. .You have experience with statistical packages such as SPSS, SAS etc. and BI/visualisation tools such as Tableau, Google Analytics etc. .You have ability to execute research projects and craft actionable recommendations. .You have proven ability to work in a fast-paced environment, meet changing deadlines and priorities on multiple simultaneous projects. .You have excellent organisational, communication, presentation and interpersonal skills. .You enjoy working in both individual and team settings. .Benefits .A flat and transparent culture .Flexible working hours - No fixed Checkin/Checkout .Unlimited Snacks, food, and drinks on the house .Tools of the trade - MacBook, Latest Softwares .Monthly Communication Reimbursement .Best learning and development opportunities .A chance to have a big impact early in your career .At Hike, we value diversity.
